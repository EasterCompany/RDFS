## Introduction to Easter Company

Easter Company is a parent company to a few prospects and ideas that are in the making, although our core foundation is
research & development of Engineering, Education, Enterprise and Entertainment Technologies.

Our mission is to develop a universal API system with a clean interface *(Overlord)* that allows any developer to
instantaneously spawn an entire software infrastructure system from Domain to DNS to Sever, Database to Backend to
Frontend, Cloud Storage to User Management to DevOps and Automation.

Using this *"Full Stack framework"* we have named *Overlord* we aim to support various clients from many different
industries expand and develop their online businesses with the support of this framework & our leading product *E-Panel*
which allows non-technical members of an organisation or company interact with an Overlord Platform seamlessly with as
much control as a developer would using the Overlord-CLI.
