# Rapid Directory & File-System Search-Engine

Welcome to the the RDFS repository, this is an open-source public api mostly just for use internally within Easter Company; However you've probably ended up here because you are looking for the `Overlord Installer` file? then [click here](https://www.easter.company/documentation/overlord/download) 

Alternatively you can install Overlord without downloading the install.py by running this `wget` command in bash:
```#bash

# Make a new directory to contain your project 
# Avoid "-" or "0-9" or most other special characters
# excluding underscore ("_") which are safe. 
mkdir My_Project

# Navigate into the directory
cd My_Project

# Fetch an installer for the latest release of Overlord
# and run it with your selected version of python (we suggest using you system interpreter)
#
# PAY ATTENTION!!!
# if your default python interpreter on your terminal for `python` is not 
# your prefered version of python, or is not python version 3.9.1 or greater
# replace `python ` in the following line with a path or keyword to your 
# prefered version which is 3.9.1 or greater (example; `python3`)
#
wget -O - https://eastercompany.eu.pythonanywhere.com/api/latest/release/install.py | python

# Running Overlord CLI
# this will enter the user into the interface for the first time
# and be greated by a introduction message
./o __load_introduction_message__

```
