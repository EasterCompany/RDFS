  ************************* ATTENTION *************************

  Overlord only supports Python 3.10 or greater and
  it looks like your system default at '/usr/bin/python3'
  is running on version '{sys.version_info[0]}.{sys.version_info[1]}'

  Unfortunately until this is fixed you'll need to install your
  Overlord application manually.

  You need to run this command from within your app directory:

  >> python3.10 core.py tools install

  you can replace 'python3.10' with whatever version you wish
  to use as long as it's a greater version

  We highly recommend Python 3.11 for it's huge performance
  benefits. Although this might not be available for you yet.

     You can get the latest version from the following link:
                https://www.python.org/downloads/
