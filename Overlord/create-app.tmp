  ************************* ATTENTION *************************
  Overlord only supports Python 3.10 or greater and
  it looks like your system default at '/usr/bin/python3'
  is running on version '{sys.version_info[0]}.{sys.version_info[1]}'

  Unfortunately until this is fixed you'll need to install your
  Overlord application manually.

  You need to run this command from within your app directory:

  >> python3.10 core.py tools install

  you can replace 'python3.10' with whatever version you wish
  to use as long as it's a greater version
